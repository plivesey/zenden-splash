# Privacy Policy

<br>

## 1. Your Personal Data
We do not store any of your personal data on our servers. Some data is stored on your personal iCloud account, inaccessible by us. The only people who can see and edit your app data are housemates you share the app with.

## 2. Debugging Data
We collect some critical error and crash reports automatically and anonymously. These are used to fix bugs quickly and are never tied to your iCloud account.

## 3. In-App Purchases
ZenDen has enabled in-app purchases. The app is available to use with a free trial for one month, and following this, you will enter into an auto-renewing subscription. Subscription cancellations must be made through your iCloud account.

## 4. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be placed here and the amended version will supersede this version of our Privacy Policy. We will notify users when major changes are made that affect how their data is stored, accessed, or used.

## 5. Contact Us
We would be happy to answer any questions about data collection and storage. Please email us at hello@zendenapp.com.
